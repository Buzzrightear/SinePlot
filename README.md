# SinePlot 
## Range of attempts to plot a sine wave using a dataset generated on the fly and machine learning techniques

> - SinePlot_RNN.py - Plots output of recurrent neural network applied to sine dataset 
> - SinePlot_Simple_Moving_Average.py - Plots simple moving average with 2x dwindow sizes applied to sine dataset
> - SinePlot_ANN.py - Attempts to create linear regression based on sine wave dataset. Doesn't work.
> - SinePlot_ANN2.py - More sophisticated effort makes some attempt to predict sine wave 
> - SinePlot_CNN.py - Attempt to predict sine wave using a convolutional neural network
